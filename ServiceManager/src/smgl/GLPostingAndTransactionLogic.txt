There are (mainly) THREE tables involved in the posting logic.  Fiscal, financial statement, and transactional
data are created or updated when a GL Transaction Batch is posted.  That is the ONLY event that can touch any
of these tables.

First, when a batch is posted, each line of the batch entry(s) becomes a new record in the gltransactionlines table.
This table is the 'history' of GL transactions, and is the data source used to produce the GL Transaction
Listing report.  These records are only inserted, at the time of the batch posting, and they are never updated.

Second - when a batch is posted, the 'fiscal set' data (including things like the opening balance for the year, and 
the net change for each period) gets updated.  This table is ONLY modified at the time of a posting.  If there is
no fiscal set record for the account and fiscal year at the time of posting, the program does an INSERT.  If
there already IS a current record for the account and fiscal year, then the program UPDATES that record. This
is the only time a fiscal set record is INSERTed or UPDATed.  Also - if there are subsequent FISCAL YEARS in the 
data, then the program will insert/update the appropriate glfiscalset records for those subsequent years.

Third, when the fiscal set records are inserted/updated, the affected financial statement records (glfinancialstatementdata)
are updated.  



THINGS TO CHECK:

1) Post transactions to a previous year for a balance sheet AND an income/expense account, then check how
it affected opening balances for the subsequent year(s).  Income/expense accounts should go to Retained Earnings.

2) Check closing the fiscal year.  How does it affect opening balances for the subsequent year?  What happens if there 
is NO following year built yet?  Does the retained earnings account opening balance for the following year seem correct?

3) 




GLFINANCIALSTATEMENTDATA:
This table gets updated by reading the glfiscalsets table.  Given a selected fiscal year and acct, the program needs
to read all the fiscal sets for that account, and that fiscal year AND the subsequent fiscal years.  (A posting can
affect the same fiscal year as the posting, but can also potentially affect any glfinancialstatement data for
subsequent years as well.)

Using the fiscal sets for the posting transaction's account and fiscal year and years thereafter, the
glfinancialstatement data gets inserted/updated like this:

glfinancialstatementdata fields:
sacctid: passed in
ifiscalyear: passed in
ifiscalperiod: we have to read ALL the fiscal periods included in the affected fiscal years, so iterate through these
bdnetchangeforperiod: read the amount in the corresponding fiscal set record for this period
bdnetchangeforperiodpreviousyear: get the record from the previous fiscal set for this period
bdtotalyeartodate: get the total for the periods to date in this fiscal year from the glfiscalset record for this year
bdtotalpreviousyeartodate:  get the total for the periods to date in the previous fiscal year from the glfiscalset record
   for the previous year
bdopeningbalancepreviousyear: get the opening balance for the previous fiscal year
bdopeningbalance: get the opening balance from the corresponding fiscal year
bdnetchangeforpreviousperiod: get the net change from the previous period from the fiscal set OR from the last net change
    in the previous year's fiscal set, if we are working with period 1
bdnetchangeforpreviousperiodpreviousyear: get the next change from the previous period of the previous year fiscal set OR
    if we are working with period 1, then get the last net change from the last period TWO years previous
